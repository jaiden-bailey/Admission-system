Admission System for Long Island University
This repository houses a sophisticated school admission system that facilitates the admission process to Long Island University through an intuitive menu-driven interface. Users can input their first, last names, and date of birth specify whether they are undergraduate or graduate students, and the system generates a unique ID number for each individual. The generation of these unique IDs is made possible by leveraging the functionalities of the "cstdlib" and "ctime" modules.

Future Objectives
Develop an enhanced feature that allows registered individuals to access their respective class information. Users will be prompted to specify their student status (undergraduate or graduate) and their ID, enabling the system to automatically provide them with the relevant class details. This feature streamlines the process for returning students and ensures the seamless retrieval of their class schedules.
